# Sunny_Boy_Logger
SB_Logger is a basic data logger for SMA SB1.5 and similar series PV inverters. It can be run as a service. It creates a new log file for each day and adds one line to the log file each minute that there is a non zero power output from the inverter. An inverter name has been hard coded into the source file; however an inverter name (Serial number) can be read from the command line. The default 502 Modbus port is used, this can be changed by providing the port number as the second command line parameter. It should work with 1.5 kW and 2.5 kW inverters, for other inverters the Modbus register that are read may need to be changed. Has been used on a RPi 2, limited testing was done for a Windows target; however this has not been tested since the code changes to allow it to operate as a linux service.
